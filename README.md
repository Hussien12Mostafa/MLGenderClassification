Handwriting-Based Gender Classification System using machine learning

    TIP you can estimate the gender using openCV and skimage only.

Data Set is CMP23 in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/essamwisamfouad/cmp23-handwritten-males-vs-females)

Project objective

    predict the gender from an image by using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Project Pipeline:

  1. reading the dataset.

  2. extract features using hinge and cold features(two files to extract features one for train datatset and one for test data).

  3. save them in featuresTrainDataSet and featuresTest(extractFeaturesTestData.ipynb and extractFeatureTrainData.ipynb).

  4. in svm.ipynb here i used svm model to train data set with features hinge only once and cold features only once and hinge and cold features togther.

  5. i found hinge only is high accuracy in test data.
